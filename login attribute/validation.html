        <!-- Explanation of title:
    1. (?:19|20):
     This part matches the first two digits of the year, allowing for any year between 1900 and 2099.
     19: Represents the 1900s.
     20: Represents the 2000s.
    2. (?:[13579][26]|[02468][048]):
    This is for leap years:
    (?:[13579][26]|[02468][048]): Matches years divisible by 4 (leap years) within the 1900-2099 range.
    [13579][26]: Odd years ending in 26 (e.g., 1926, 2026), valid leap years.
    [02468][048]: Even years ending in 048 or multiples of 4 (e.g., 1904, 2008).
    3. (?:0[1-9]|1[0-2]):
   This part validates the month portion:
   0[1-9]: Matches months 01 to 09 (January to September).
   1[0-2]: Matches months 10 to 12 (October to December).
   3. (?:0[1-9]|1[0-2]):
   This part validates the month portion:
   0[1-9]: Matches months 01 to 09 (January to September).
   1[0-2]: Matches months 10 to 12 (October to December).
   4. (?:0[1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]):
   This matches valid days in months that can have 29 days (accounts for leap years).
   0[1-9]: Matches days 01 to 09.
   1[0-9]: Matches days 10 to 19.
   2[0-9]: Matches days 20 to 29.
   5. (?:(?!02)(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(?:30)):
   This part matches months that can have 30 days, but excludes February:
   (?!02): Negative lookahead that prevents the pattern from matching February.
   (?:0[1-9]|1[0-2]): Matches months 01 to 12.
   (?:30): Matches day 30.
   This ensures that only months other than February can have 30 days.
   6. (?:(?:0[13578]|1[02])-31):
   This part matches months that can have 31 days:
   0[13578]: Matches months 01 (January), 03 (March), 05 (May), 07 (July), and 08 (August).
   1[02]: Matches months 10 (October) and 12 (December).
   -31: Matches day 31.
   7. [0-9]{2}:
   This part matches non-leap years:
   [0-9]{2}: Matches the last two digits of the year for non-leap years (any two digits, regardless of leap year rules).
   8. (?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(?:0[1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-8]):
   This part matches non-leap year February (01-28):
   This handles the validation for days in months other than February for non-leap years (with days 01 to 28).
   9. (?:(?!02)(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(?:29|30)):
   This part validates months that can have 29 or 30 days, excluding February, for non-leap years.
   10. (?:(?:0[13578]|1[02])-31):
   This part validates months that can have 31 days, again ensuring that only those months that have 31 days are accepted.-->
